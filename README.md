## Archive for R/BTC: BCH Subreddit
-  Disclaimer: It has been argued by BCH supporters that R/BTC is not exclusively a BCH subreddit. But, whereas the term "R/BTC community/subreddit" might be used. The term "BTC community/subreddit" would not be. This is because it would be strange for the "BCH communinity/subreddit" to refer to itself as the "BTC community/subreddit", despite using R/BTC as their subreddit.
